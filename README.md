## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations. By analyzing HR data, this project aims to identify key drivers of attrition and predict which employees are at risk of leaving. The analysis leverages data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis of HR datasets
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Visualization of attrition trends and factors
- Actionable recommendations for HR management

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MDineshKarthik/Job-Attrition-HR-Analysis.git
   cd Job-Attrition-HR-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

1. Place your HR dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run exploratory data analysis:
   ```bash
   python src/eda.py
   ```
3. Train and evaluate models:
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```
4. View results and visualizations in the `outputs/` directory.
